# ASOS Axure Prototype

Working prototype of the ASOS website built in Axure RP 8.

## About this project

This project is a recreation of the ASOS website circa 2017. As part of a college assignment, I was tasked with reverse engineering an existing website to identify the grid system, typography, color scheme and UI components, with the goal of recreating a functioning prototype using [Axure RP](https://www.axure.com/).
