# ASOS Axure Prototype

Working prototype of ASOS' website built in Axure RP.

## About this project

This project is a recreation of the ASOS website circa 2017. As part of a college assignment, I was tasked with reverse engineering an existing website to identify the grid system, typography, colour scheme and UI components. Having identified these elements, a functioning prototype of the website was created using [Axure RP](https://www.axure.com/).
