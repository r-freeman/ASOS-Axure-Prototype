# ASOS Axure Prototype

Working prototype of the ASOS website built in Axure RP 8.

## About this project

This project is a recreation of the ASOS website circa 2017. As part of a college assignment I was tasked with identifying the grid system, typography and color scheme of a popular website and recreating a functioning prototype using [Axure RP](https://www.axure.com/).
